A Hitchhiker's Guide to Computing

How does code do things in the real world??

Intuition - 
Mindset - 

The goal of this book is to be an aid in helping develop an intuition and
conceptual understanding of electronics and embedded computer programming.

This book might be helpful for you, if:

1) You want to learn how computers work, at the most basic level
2) You are interested in taking up electronics as a hobby, or have a project
   you want to do.

This book has several sections:

Foundational Topics

* Basics of Electronics - power sources, voltage and current, components
* How Computers Work, From the Ground Up - logic gates, digital logic, CPUs
* Interacting with the Outside World - Peripherals
* Running Code - compiling, linking, programming, and code

Projects

System Building

These chapters start small, and try to make as few assumptions as 
possible regarding your prior exposure to programming or hardware tinkering.
They avoid going into very deep mathematical detail, and favor concepts
over equations.

* Working with Electronics
    * soldering?
    * breadboarding?
* Embedded Programming
* Building Electronics
* Hardware Design
